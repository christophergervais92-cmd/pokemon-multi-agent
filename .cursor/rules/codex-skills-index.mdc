# Codex Skills (Vendored)

This repo vendors the Codex desktop app skills under `codex_skills/` so Cursor can use the same playbooks.

## Usage

- If the user mentions a skill by name (example: `openai-docs`), open the matching `SKILL.md` from the **File** path below and follow it.
- If multiple skills are mentioned, apply them in the order mentioned.
- Keep context small: do not load every skill body. Only open the skill(s) needed for the current task.

## Skills

- `cloudflare-deploy`: Deploy applications and infrastructure to Cloudflare using Workers, Pages, and related platform services. Use when the user asks to deploy, host, publish, or set up a project on Cloudflare. (file: `codex_skills/cloudflare-deploy/SKILL.md`)
- `cursor-rules-bridge`: Apply merged Cursor operating rules for software tasks: enforce 3-layer architecture (directive/orchestration/execution), run a mandatory security and quality gate before completion, and execute on-demand compound review, auto-compound, or Ralph loop workflows. Use when users mention compound review, auto-compound, Ralph, project governance, or security hardening. (file: `codex_skills/cursor-rules-bridge/SKILL.md`)
- `develop-web-game`: Use when Codex is building or iterating on a web game (HTML/JS) and needs a reliable development + testing loop: implement small changes, run a Playwright-based test script with short input bursts and intentional pauses, inspect screenshots/text, and review console errors with render_game_to_text. (file: `codex_skills/develop-web-game/SKILL.md`)
- `doc`: Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks. (file: `codex_skills/doc/SKILL.md`)
- `figma`: Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting. (file: `codex_skills/figma/SKILL.md`)
- `figma-implement-design`: Translate Figma nodes into production-ready code with 1:1 visual fidelity using the Figma MCP workflow (design context, screenshots, assets, and project-convention translation). Trigger when the user provides Figma URLs or node IDs, or asks to implement designs or components that must match Figma specs. Requires a working Figma MCP server connection. (file: `codex_skills/figma-implement-design/SKILL.md`)

- `openai-docs`: Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations (for example: Codex, Responses API, Chat Completions, Apps SDK, Agents SDK, Realtime, model capabilities or limits); prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains. (file: `codex_skills/openai-docs/SKILL.md`)
- `pdf`: Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction. (file: `codex_skills/pdf/SKILL.md`)
