# Vendored Codex Skill Paths

This repo vendors the Codex desktop app skills under `codex_skills/`.

When a skill doc references paths under `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill>/...`, prefer the repo-local equivalent:

- `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill>/...` -> `codex_skills/<skill>/...`

Example:

```bash
export WEB_GAME_CLIENT="codex_skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js"
export WEB_GAME_ACTIONS="codex_skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json"
```
