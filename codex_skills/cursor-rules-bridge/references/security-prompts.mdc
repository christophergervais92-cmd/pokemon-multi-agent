# Security & break-it prompts

Use when reviewing or hardening code:

- **Break the function:** "Write 20 unit tests designed to break this function."
- **Pentest mindset:** "Find every security vulnerability in this file. Think like a pentester." (SQL injection, auth bypasses, privilege escalation, input validation gaps.)
- **Edge cases:** "Generate 50 edge cases: null, empty strings, negative numbers, unicode, arrays with 100k items." (Paste into Hypothesis for automated fuzzing.)
- **Secrets audit:** "Audit this entire codebase for leaked secrets." (API keys in comments, passwords in config files, tokens in error messages.)
